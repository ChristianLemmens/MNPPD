---- Run characterization ----
Spitzer spectrum and starfit component have been normalized by a factor such that spitzer spectrum has maximum value of unity (1). maximum dust Priors have been chosen such that maximum op opacity curve is equal to unity.

Old opacities (Atilla)

---- Priors -------
All dust initial guess values are 0.

C1		uniform		max = 0.25
Trim_min	uniform		1400 - 1000
qrim		uniform
C2		uniform
Tmid_min	uniform
Tmid_max	uniform		1200-500
qmid		uniform
Tatm_min	uniform
Tatm_max	uniform		1200-500

dust params x13	uniform --> minimal values are 0 zero
